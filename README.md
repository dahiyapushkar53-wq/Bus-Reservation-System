# Bus Reservation System (C)

## Introduction
This project is a console-based Bus Reservation System developed using the C programming language.  
It allows users to log in and perform basic reservation operations such as booking tickets, canceling tickets, and checking bus availability.

The project is intended for academic learning and demonstrates fundamental C programming concepts.

---

## Problem Statement
Manual bus ticket booking systems are time-consuming and prone to errors.  
This project aims to create a simple automated system that manages bus seat reservations efficiently.

---

## Project Objectives
- To design a menu-driven application in C
- To implement user authentication
- To manage bus seat booking and cancellation
- To display real-time bus status

---

## Features
- User login system
- Book bus tickets
- Cancel booked tickets
- Check bus details and available seats
- Logout option
- Simple and user-friendly interface

---

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C
- Compiler: GCC
- Platform: Console-based application

---

## System Requirements
- Any operating system (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- C compiler (GCC recommended)
- Basic knowledge of C programming

---

## How to Compile and Run

1. Open terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile the program:

Working of the System

The user logs in using a valid username and password.

After login, the user can book tickets, cancel tickets, or check bus status.

Seat availability updates automatically after booking or cancellation.

The user can log out or exit the system.

Limitations

Data is not stored permanently (no file handling).

Seat numbers are not assigned individually.

No admin module.

Future Scope

Add file handling for permanent storage

Introduce admin panel

Seat number allocation

Online payment integration
