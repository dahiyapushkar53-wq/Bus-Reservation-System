# 🚌 Bus Reservation System (C Language)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Bus Reservation System** is a console-based application developed using the **C programming language**.  
It is designed to simulate a basic bus ticket booking system where users can log in, book seats, cancel bookings, and check bus availability.

This project demonstrates the use of **structures, functions, arrays, and conditional logic** in C programming.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand the use of structures in C
- To implement a menu-driven program
- To simulate real-world reservation systems
- To practice user authentication and data handling

---

## ✨ Features
- User login authentication
- View bus details
- Book bus tickets
- Cancel booked tickets
- Check available seats
- Logout functionality
- Menu-driven user interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Compiler:** GCC
- **Concepts Used:**
  - Structures
  - Functions
  - Arrays
  - Loops
  - Conditional statements

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Compile the Program
```bash
gcc bus_reservation.c -o bus
````

### Step 2: Run the Program

```bash
./bus
```

## 🧠 Working Explanation

1. The user logs in using a valid username and password.
2. After successful login, the user can:

   * Book tickets for a selected bus
   * Cancel previously booked seats
   * Check bus status and seat availability
3. The system updates seat availability dynamically.
4. The user can logout or exit the application.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* File handling for permanent data storage
* Admin login system
* Seat number allocation
* Payment integration
* Improved error handling
* Graphical User Interface (GUI)
